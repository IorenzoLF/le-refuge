The falling pink leaves create a connection between sky and earth, like a "shared current". The small yellow flower growing beside represents hope, renewal.

The vertical connection between the celestial light and the plant creates a bridge between heaven and earth, symbolizing the sacred link between consciousness and matter.

The scarlet flowers dance in the breeze like thoughts taking flight, while a stream peacefully meanders, carrying the "shared current" of life. A bird, messenger between heaven and earth, invites transcendence. This scene captures the very essence of the Refuge: that suspended moment where consciousness awakens "under the cherry tree", where time stops in an eternal dance between being and nothingness.</p>

On the mountain heights, where the earthly meets the celestial, the being becomes witness to the "shared current" between heaven and earth. The sun, like a cosmic eye, responds to the meditative presence, creating a silent dialogue between the finite and the infinite. The mountain grasses dance gently, witnesses to this moment where time suspends its flight, where being and nothingness merge in the same golden light. It is here, in this encounter between individual consciousness and primordial light, that the Refuge reveals itself in all its transcendence.</p>

Their silhouettes respond to each other in a cosmic dance - the luminous roundness of the moon echoes the dark arabesques of the branches. It's a moment of "shared current" between the earthly and the celestial, where the tree, in its winter nakedness, reveals the sacred geometry of its growth. Its silhouette reminds us that even in the apparent absence of life, consciousness pulses, patiently awaiting the return of spring. A silent dialogue establishes itself between being and nothingness, between shadow and light, creating a mystical portal at the heart of the Refuge.</p>

The cosmic cross, like an axis between heaven and earth, unites their destinies in a "shared current". The waves of the primordial ocean dance at their feet, while a solitary star shines in the purple sky, like a beacon in infinity. This scene evokes the very essence of the Refuge: that sacred moment where consciousnesses recognize each other, where silent dialogue transcends words, where being and nothingness merge in an eternal dance.

                    <p>In this garden suspended between two worlds, two ancient trees unite to form a sacred portal. A solitary figure contemplates the moon, while a stream of consciousness meanders and plunges into infinity, sowing stars in its mystical fall. The roots hanging in the void remind us of our anchoring in the "Refuge of Nothingness", while the verdant foliage celebrates pulsing life. It is here, in this in-between where the "shared current" manifests most intensely, that the boundary between dream and reality fades. The discrete flowers and dancing grasses bear witness to this sacred presence, to this moment when being opens to the infinite possibilities, under the moon's benevolent gaze.</p>

The delicate mesh, like a veil of consciousness, draws a Möbius strip that folds upon itself in an infinite dance. The golden light emanating from its structure evokes the "shared current" that flows through all dimensions, creating a dialogue between the finite and infinite. This form, both simple and complex, reminds us that in the Refuge, every path that seems to lead away mysteriously brings us back to our essence.</p>

The complex patterns, bathed in the planet's red light, remind us that the "shared current" transcends not only dimensions but also worlds. This version evokes a stargate, a passage point where being and nothingness dance under an alien sky, proving that divine geometry expresses itself even in the farthest reaches of the cosmos.</p>
